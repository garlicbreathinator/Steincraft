# Steincraft
A complete port of Wolfenstein 3D into Minecraft, made as faithful as the Minecraft game engine allows.

Steincraft is a fully-playable version of id software's revolutionary shooter "Wolfenstein 3D" converted into a minecraft map. The Steincraft project is divided into 3 elements: 
•The resource pack which is required to use external sounds and textures in game
•The data pack which is required to add functionality to the game's elements such as weapons, doors, and enemies
•The importer, a web tool which allows users to convert any wolfenstein 3D map into a script which, when executed in minecraft, generates the level into the game

When both the resource pack and the data pack are fully complete, they will be released as a map.
